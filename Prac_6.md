Website Payment System – Scha0147========Background========Making payment online has become very popular over the past few years. It provides the convenience of being able to make purchases at home for customers. The website advertises products and from there the customer has the option to make a purchase and use that payment system. These systems generally require a valid credit card to make a purchase. Systems such as these are heavily relied upon and for businesses that solely trade via the Internet a faulty/broken payment system will halt business all together.Design========This test plan is built around conducting payment on a website. This system allows customers to make purchases online and is quite a core function of the website.System Stages In System========These are the primary functions that the system will need to be able to handle:```Enter Payment Credentials:- Card holder name.- Card Number.- CCV.Communication with Bank:- Valid card holder.- Valid amount for payment available.Order Placed:- Confirmed order.- Money received.- Order lodged.```Any breach of these will cause problems with the systems functionality.Risks and Severity (potential issues)========We need to outline the risks in this system to derive appropriate tests. Anything that would make the system fail and stop business would be the most important aspects to check. Risks are:-Customer can pay for item and item order is not lodged.-Order is lodged, no payment received.-Invalid funds.-Customer purchases an item that is ‘out of stock’.Worst risk being:Customer can pay for item and item order is not lodged. This can most certainly result in bad reputation.Testing Methods:========Integration Testing:This type of test looks at the different modules of the system running together as a whole. So we need to:Make sure communications can be made to all banks for purchasing. Also clearly establish cards that are and aren’t accepted (AMEX etc…). Deny all those who aren’t accepted.Check stock levels and deny purchases on an out of stock item.Stress Testing:This would put the system under heavy load. This needs to be tested as the system could potentially be exposed to this in the real world. To test this we can lodge many orders at once, including orders which should be invalid, to test systems capabilities and functionality under a heavy load.Usability Testing:This test concerns the users, we may want them to look at:Allow flexibility for customers: provide alternate methods of payment.Is the system visually appealing?Can it be easily manipulated and if not is there information that is easily sourced to solve any issues?Recovery Testing:If something breaks, it needs to be identified and fixed quickly to allow business to continue quickly. How is problem identified? How quickly can it be dealt with? Is there alternative ways of continuing business while system is repaired?End to End Testing:This looks at testing the systems primary function from start to finish. Can system cope with a basic operation: purchase something? To test this we would purchase a item with a valid card and lodge an order.System Testing (Black Box Testing):System software and hardware can be tested here. System is tested as a whole to determine:Does system meet requirements?Does system cope with most basic functions?Does system cope with a heavy load? If not may need to increase efficiency of software or increase hardware.Three most important:End to End:If the system cant cope with a function its primary purpose is to do then the system is useless.Stress Testing:Real world scenarios may involve many people ordering and purchasing at once, system needs to be able to handle this.If it cannot then it potentially stops business.Perfect example: https://www.catchoftheday.com.au/I read about this site being DDOS’d by people orders when the specials where being launched as stock levels where very low.Integration Testing:Needed for making sure system works with others and eliminates many problems that may arise. This again stops business, which is extremely bad for customer and company.Three lesser important:Recovery Testing:Still important, if system goes down trading stops, problem needs to be identified and fixed quickly.This is not as important as the other 3 because the others issues could arise more frequently.System Testing:Need to meet requirements.Need to do what its meant to do…Usability Testing:Flexibility for user.Visually appealing.Easy to use/information on how to use.Not very important as it does not halt business
